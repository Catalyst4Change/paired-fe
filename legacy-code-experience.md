## Where will you start in the codebase, and why did you decide to start there?
### first things first, read the README. that gives me a basic understanding of what to expect from the project.  
### after that, i looked into the Public folder which has a great gif showing it's capabilities.
### then i just dove right into the Components and Containers and tried to get an understanding of how it works.

## What is familiar to you about the codebase?
### the basic React file sysytem is recognizable, although much more complicated that anything i've interacted with so far.

## Are you making any assumptions? If so, what are they?
### probably, but none that i could articulate.

## How are you identifying what files are relevant to your issue?
### I am simply trying to familiarize myself with this code. If I was looking for a specific bug, the folder system would give me a leg up in my search.

## What is the data flow in the application?
### The user logs in, is able to schedule a meeting w their Rock, get confirmation texts about it.

## What is unfamiliar? (different file structures, new packages or gems, etc.)
## ALL of these ancillary technologies are new to me. 
Firebase, PostgreSQL, Redux, Flask, all the test suites...

## Is there technology that you would need to research?
### all of the above

## Include the link to documentation for that technology
### https://firebase.google.com
### https://www.postgresql.org/about/
### https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started  

## Include at least one other source, such as an article/video you might use to gain an understanding of that technology (You do not need to read/watch).
### https://youtu.be/9zySeP5vH9c

## Include what search terms you used to find that source.
